			<h2>Why is sustainability in fashion important?</h2> 

			<p>
			  The fashion industry is unfortunately one of the most wasteful industries on the planet. It contributes about 10 percent of total global carbon emissions. According to 
			  <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashion-and-emissions-whats-the-link/">Earth.org</a>, the industry dries up water sources and contributes to pollution of rivers and streams with waste from dyeing and finishing clothes. Washing clothes also adds to the microfibers that end up polluting the ocean. Around 500,000 tons of microfibers are released into the ocean each year from washing clothes.

			<p>
			  With the rise of fast fashion, the environmental effects are quickly increasing. It is estimated that 85 percent of fast fashion ends up in landfills, which are often located in developing nations. This poisons waterways, destroys local ecosystems, and harms the health of those who unfortunately live in proximity to these landfills. For example, in Ghana, clothes from fast fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, Primark, etc. have been found washed up on beaches and in protected wetlands. Ghana, being the world's largest importer of used clothes, has unfortunately been nicknamed the world's fashion graveyard, with 15 million items arriving weekly according to an

				<h2>What can you do?</h2>

				<p>
				  So what can be done to help? Simple things like reducing consumption of clothing or buying secondhand are great steps. Buying from sustainable brands is also a great way to support companies that seek to help the planet and reduce the waste that the fashion industry produces. 
				  <a href="benita-page-2.html">Here</a> you can find some brands that are sustainable and challenge the current status quo of the industry today through unique and groundbreaking methods. You can also try upcycling â€” reusing old clothes and making them into new pieces. We only have this planet, so we must make sure to care for it in all ways we can.
