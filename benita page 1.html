			 <h2>Why is sustainablilty in fashion important?</h2> 
			 
			 <p> The fashion industry is unfortunately one of the most wasteful industries on the planet. it contribiute about 10 percent of total global carbon emissions. According to <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashion-and-emissions-whats-the-link/">Earth.org</a> the industry dries up water sources and contributes to pollution of rivers and streams with waste from dying the clothes, finishing the product. Washing clothes also adds to the microfibers that end up polluting the ocean. Around 500,000 tons of microfibers are realesed into the ocean each year from washing clothes. </p>

			 <p> With the rise of fast fashion, the environmental effects are quickly increasing. It is estimated that 85 percent of fast fashion ends up in landfills, which are often located in developing natioins. This poisons water ways, destroys local ecosytems and harms the health of those are unfortunately live in any proximity to these landfill. For Example in Ghana clothes from fast fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, primark, etc have been found washed up on beaches and in protetcted wetlands. Ghana being the worlds largets importer of used closths has unfortunately been nicknamed the worlds fashion graveyard with 15 million items arriving weekly according to an <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2025/06/18/uk-brands-fashion-dumps-african-protected-wetlands/">Unearthed</a> article. </p>
